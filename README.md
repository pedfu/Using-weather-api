# Using-weather-api
A simple website that returns a temperature of a city.

## Steps to test it

* You will need nodejs installed
* Go to the place where you saved this folder, right click and open the terminal
I reccomend you using a linux/mac terminal or simulates it using hyper (you will need git bash to use it)
* To initialize the project, use: "npm init" -> enter for everything or answer whatever you want
* Then install body-parser: "npm i body-parser"
* Then install express: "npm i express"
* In the terminal, write: "node app.js"
* Open the localhost:3000 on your navegator

If everything was correctly configured, you can type the name of the city and you will get a temperature as a response.
